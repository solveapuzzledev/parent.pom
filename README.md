# Release Baselining (Maven snapshots, releases)

Release versions are baselined into an S3 Bucket owned by 
solveapuzzledev.  The extension [maven-s3-wagon](https://github.com/jcaddel/maven-s3-wagon) is used to communicate to S3.  

The build server will need authentication/authorisation to the S3 bucket to do this.
